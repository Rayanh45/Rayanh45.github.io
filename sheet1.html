     <p> The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s leadership and people will celebrate tomorrow, Wednesday,<strong> <em> September 23, 2020, the 90th </em></strong> National Day of Saudi Arabia, after the<br> historical announcement of the late King Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud of Saudi Arabia’s unification under "There is no god but Allah; Muhammad is the <br> Messenger of Allah" banner.</p> 
<p> Saudi National Day is the day on which the late founder named the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia throughout the country, after 32 years of wars.
    On that day, a young <br>  country was established that prided itself by the application of the Islamic Sharia and its preservation of human values, promoting peace and goodness and in search of <br> knowledge and development towards a better future for its people, the Islamic nation and the whole world.</p>
