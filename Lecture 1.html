<p> <strong> <h2>  What is web programming? </h2> </strong>  </p>
<p> <h4> Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content,
 Web client and server scripting and network security. <br> <br>  The most common languages used
 for Web programming are <em> <u> XML, HTML, JavaScript,
 Perl 5 and PHP </u> </em>. <br> <br>  Web programming is different from just programming,
 which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology. </h4> </p>
